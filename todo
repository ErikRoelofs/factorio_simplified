Approach:
- determine the cost in only intermediates for each item
- recursively go down the items

- automatically determine item tiers
  - intermediate tier = tier of highest ingredient + 1 (after downgrading non-intermediates)
  - this will always build from the ground up; so if the max-tier is reached, everything can be downgraded)

- add some settings:
  - crop ingredient counts
    - crop out the lowest values?
  - include some level of intermediates
  - reduce speed of cost increase over levels
  
- mod compatibility:
  - better handling of probabilistic recipes
  - better handling of multi-output recipes
  - some handling of multiple recipes producing the same item

- support auto-finding directly mineable resources
